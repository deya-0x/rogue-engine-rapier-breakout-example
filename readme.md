# Rogue Engine - Breakout Example with Rapier

This example demonstrates how to use the Rapier physics engine with the Rogue Engine for a very simple breakout game.

# Notes

- I wanted to make this as a simple example and to point out how to work with Rapier since it is loaded as a WASM module.
- BIG Thank you to BeardScript for helping out with understanding how to handle the WASM module loading.
- This also shows how to set Restitution and Friction values for the ball, walls and blocks so it can continue to bounce around.
